# TelegramBotAPI
 Telegram Bot API for Wolfram Language by [TBpack Ltd.](https://www.tbpack.co.uk/)

## Installation guide
 - **The recommended option** in Mathematica 12.1+ ``PacletInstall["url"]`` can be used for the installation straight away: [<img align="right" src="https://github.com/vasilsaroka/TelegramBotAPI/blob/main/Pictures/Logo_TBpack.png" alt="TBpack Logo" width="250"/>](https://www.tbpack.co.uk/)



        
        PacletInstall["https://github.com/vasilsaroka/TelegramBotAPI/releases/download/v<version>/TelegramBotAPI-<version>.paclet"]  
   where `<version>` stands for any existing version of the application. For example,
   
       PacletInstall["https://github.com/vasilsaroka/TelegramBotAPI/releases/download/v0.1.0/TelegramBotAPI-0.1.0.paclet"]
   
 - An alternative manual intallation option for Mathematica 10.0+ is the following. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/vasilsaroka/TelegramBotAPI/releases), distributed as a `.paclet` file, and install it using the `PacletInstall` function in Mathematica:

        Needs["PacletManager`"]
        PacletInstall["path2paclet"]
        
   Insert `path2paclet` via Mathematica's Insert â†’ File Path... menu command.
   
## Demo
### Basic response loop
 - Evaluate ``<<TelegramBotAPI` `` to load the package into the Wolfram Language session.
 - Test TelegramBotAPI using `?getUpdates` to invoke help for the given function. Do the same for functions `getChatId, getMessageText, sendMessage`.
 - Create your own bot and obtain a bot token following [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) instructions.
 - Set `$BotToken` constant of ``TelegramBotAPI` `` context to the bot token obtained from BotFather in the previous step:

       $BotToken="your bot token here"
   
 - Write "Hi" message to your bot in Telegram.
 - Evaluate the following code to get the update with you "Hi" message in the Wolfram Language session:

       update = Last[getUpdates[]]
     
 - Reply to the "Hi" message from within your Wolfram Language session:

       sendMessage[getChatId[update], "Hi there :) "]
   
 Congratulations! You have just implemented the basic bot response loop! Now we can try to run it infinitely long by using available programming loops.
 ### Running the basic response loop
 - A simple function for running basic response loop can be defined as follows:

       Clear[BotMain];
       BotMain[] := Block[
       {
        update, updateId, chatId, messagetext
       },
       update = Last[getUpdates[]];
       updateId = Lookup[update, "update_id"];
       While[
   	          True,
             	update = Last[getUpdates[]];
   	          If[
    		            updateId == Lookup[update, "update_id"],
    		            (* new update is available; try to get chat id and message text *)
    		            chatId = getChatId[update];
    		            messagetext = getMessageText[update];
                  (* reply to the message \*)
    		            Switch[
     				                  messagetext,
     				                  "Hi", sendMessage[chatId, "Hi :)"],
     				                  "Mahal kita", sendMessage[chatId, "Mahal din kita"],
                           _, 
                           sendMessage[chatId, "Sorry, I do not understand this message :)"]	
     		          ](* end Switch *);
    		        updateId++ 
    	         ](* end If *);
       ](* end While *)
       ](* end Block *)
   
 - Copy and paste the above function into Wolfram Notebook cell and evaluate it to make the definition of the function known to the current session. [<img align="right" src="https://github.com/vasilsaroka/TelegramBotAPI/blob/main/Pictures/Aminat_Nweke%2BOpenAI.JPG" alt="TBpack Logo" width="250"/>](https://t.me/AminatNweke_tbpack_bot)

 - Run the above defined function in a separate Notebook cell:
    
       BotMain[]

Congratulations! Now your bot is active and responsive. To terminate the cell evaluation (that is set to run *infinitely long!*) use `Alt+.`.

More complicated bots including LLMs and functions like `SpeechRecognize` can be developed with a similar structure in mind. See, for example, our conference virtual secretary [Aminat](https://t.me/AminatNweke_tbpack_bot) 

Put a star to this repository if you think other API functions, such as those used for [Aminat](https://t.me/AminatNweke_tbpack_bot), should be released.
